This is an example implementation of a phase field model for cell motility on the GPU using CUDA. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own projects.

The code here is based on the model utilized in the following paper *please* cite it:
 ` Kulawiak DA, Camley BA, Rappel W-J (2016) Modeling Contact Inhibition of Locomotion of Colliding Cells Migrating on Micropatterned Substrates. PLoS Comput Biol 12(12): e1005239. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005239`
 Please note, that this is NOT a full reimplementation and certain features are not implemented.
